# Project Brief

This document outlines the core requirements and goals of the project. It serves as the foundation for all other Memory Bank documents and the source of truth for the project scope.

## Core Requirements

- **Functionality:** The project aims to develop an AI assistant.
- **Capabilities:**
    - Parse and understand user messages.
    - Extract relevant information from messages, including XML tags.
    - Interact with a set of tools to perform actions.
    - Manage and update a "Memory Bank" for contextual awareness.
- **Technology Stack (Initial Thoughts):**
    - Backend: Node.js with TypeScript
    - Frontend: (To be determined)

## Goals

- Create a robust and extensible AI assistant framework.
- Enable the assistant to learn and adapt through its Memory Bank.
- Provide a clear and maintainable codebase.
- Ensure the assistant can effectively utilize its tools.

## Scope

- **In Scope:**
    - Core assistant logic (message parsing, tool interaction, memory management).
    - Initial set of tools for basic functionalities.
    - Memory Bank implementation and update mechanisms.
- **Out of Scope (Initially):**
    - Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU) beyond basic parsing.
    - Complex UI/UX design.
    - Deployment to production environments.
