# Progress

This document tracks what functionalities are working, what remains to be built, the current status of various components, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

-   **WebSocket Support:** The backend server now supports WebSocket connections. Clients can connect, send messages, and receive messages (currently echoes) via WebSockets.
-   **Memory Bank Foundation:** The core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been initialized.
-   The assistant (Gemini) can create and edit these Markdown files.
-   **`parseAssistantMessage` Integration:** The `parseAssistantMessage` function from [`backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`](backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts) has been integrated into the main application flow in [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts). A new POST route `/assistant/message` is now available to handle and parse assistant messages.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

-   **Core Assistant Logic:**
    -   Message parsing (including the current XML parsing task).
    -   Intent recognition.
    -   Tool execution framework.
    -   Response generation.
    -   Advanced WebSocket message processing and integration with assistant core logic.
-   **Tool Implementations:** Specific implementations for each defined tool (e.g., `codebase_search`, `edit_file`, etc., beyond the AI's intrinsic ability to call them).
-   **Memory Bank Management Automation:** Scripts or functions for the assistant to more autonomously manage its Memory Bank updates (beyond just editing files when told).
-   **Testing Suite:** Unit and integration tests for all components.
-   **User Interface (if any beyond CLI/IDE integration):** To be defined.

## Current Status

-   **Overall Project Status:** Initiation phase. Foundational documentation established. Basic HTTP and WebSocket communication implemented.
-   **Current Task:** WebSocket support added.
-   **Status:** Successfully integrated into [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts). A new POST route `/assistant/message` now handles and parses assistant messages. This builds upon the previously unit-tested `parseAssistantMessage` function ([`backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`](backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts) and [`backend/test/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.test.ts`](backend/test/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.test.ts)). WebSocket server is up and running, capable of basic message echoing.

## Known Issues

-   None explicitly identified yet, as development is in its nascent stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Initial decision to use Markdown files for the Memory Bank. *Reasoning:* Human-readability, ease of editing, and version control friendliness.
-   **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Decision to start XML parsing with a regex-based approach. *Reasoning:* Simplicity for initial implementation. Will re-evaluate if complexity requires a dedicated library. (Tracked in `activeContext.md`).

*(This section should be updated as decisions are made or changed throughout the project lifecycle.)*
