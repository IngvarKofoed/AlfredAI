# Progress

This document tracks what functionalities are working, what remains to be built, the current status of various components, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

-   **‚úÖ MCP Server Persistence:** MCP server configurations now persist across backend server restarts:
    - Server configurations are saved to `mcp-servers.json` file in JSON format
    - Configurations automatically load and reconnect on server startup
    - Supports adding, removing, and updating server configurations
    - Includes security protection via .gitignore for sensitive API keys
    - Example configuration file provided for user guidance
    - Integration with MCP consumer tool for complete server management
-   **‚úÖ /tools Command:** Comprehensive tool and capability discovery:
    - Shows all native tools (weather, randomNumber, executeCommand, mcpConsumer) with descriptions
    - Lists MCP server connection status (üü¢ Connected / üî¥ Disconnected)
    - Displays available tools from each connected MCP server with descriptions
    - Handles disconnected servers and errors gracefully
    - Provides guidance on how to use tools through natural conversation
    - Integrated with CLI autocomplete and help system
-   **‚úÖ Command Autocomplete (CLI):** The CLI now provides real-time command suggestions when users type '/':
    - Instantly shows all available commands with descriptions when '/' is typed
    - Navigation with arrow keys, Enter to select, Escape to cancel
    - Commands auto-execute when selected from the autocomplete menu
    - Visual distinction with blue border for command suggestions
    - Seamless integration with existing CLI input modes
    - Improves command discoverability and typing efficiency
-   **‚úÖ Command System:** Users can now use helpful commands for conversation management:
    - `/clear` - Clears conversation history and provides confirmation feedback
    - `/history` - Shows conversation history with message count and truncated content
    - `/status` - Displays system status including message count, available tools, and connection info
    - `/tools` - Lists all available tools and MCP servers with connection status
    - `/help` - Lists all available commands with descriptions
    - Commands are processed immediately without LLM involvement for fast response
    - Unknown commands provide helpful error messages directing users to available options
-   **‚úÖ Conversation Context Persistence:** The LLM now maintains context across multiple user messages within a session. The system:
    - Maintains conversation history at the Client level across task instances
    - Passes complete conversation history to each new ButlerTask
    - Preserves user messages, assistant responses, and follow-up interactions
    - Enables natural multi-turn conversations with full context retention
    - Provides logging for conversation history tracking and debugging
-   **‚úÖ CLI Dual-Mode Question Answering:** The CLI client now supports both predefined question selection and freeform text input when the AI provides questions. Users can:
    - Select from a list of predefined questions using arrow keys
    - Choose "‚úèÔ∏è Type custom answer..." to switch to freeform input mode
    - Type custom responses with full text input capabilities
    - Navigate back from custom input to selection using the Escape key
    - Visual distinction between modes (cyan border for selection, magenta for custom input)
-   **‚úÖ MCP Protocol Implementation:** Complete Model Context Protocol communication is now implemented and functional. The system can:
    - Connect to MCP servers using stdio transport
    - List available tools and resources from connected servers
    - Execute tools with parameters and receive results
    - Read resources from MCP servers
    - Handle connection management with automatic reconnection
    - Manage multiple MCP server connections simultaneously
-   **WebSocket Support:** The backend server now supports WebSocket connections. Clients can connect, send messages, and receive messages (currently echoes) via WebSockets.
-   **Memory Bank Foundation:** The core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been initialized.
-   The assistant (Gemini) can create and edit these Markdown files.
-   **`parseAssistantMessage` Integration:** The `parseAssistantMessage` function from [`backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`](backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts) has been integrated into the main application flow in [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts). A new POST route `/assistant/message` is now available to handle and parse assistant messages.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

-   **MCP Integration Testing:** End-to-end testing with real MCP servers to validate the implementation.
-   **Core Assistant Logic:**
    -   Message parsing (including the current XML parsing task).
    -   Intent recognition.
    -   Tool execution framework.
    -   Response generation.
    -   Advanced WebSocket message processing and integration with assistant core logic.
-   **Tool Implementations:** Specific implementations for each defined tool (e.g., `codebase_search`, `edit_file`, etc., beyond the AI's intrinsic ability to call them).
-   **Memory Bank Management Automation:** Scripts or functions for the assistant to more autonomously manage its Memory Bank updates (beyond just editing files when told).
-   **Testing Suite:** Unit and integration tests for all components.
-   **User Interface (if any beyond CLI/IDE integration):** To be defined.

## Current Status

-   **Overall Project Status:** Development phase. Foundational infrastructure completed including MCP protocol implementation with persistent storage, conversation context persistence, user command system, CLI command autocomplete, and comprehensive tool discovery.
-   **Current Task:** MCP server persistence implementation completed successfully.
-   **Status:** 
    - ‚úÖ **MCP Server Persistence:** Complete implementation with file-based configuration storage, auto-reconnection, and management tools
    - ‚úÖ **/tools Command:** Comprehensive tool and MCP server listing with connection status and capabilities
    - ‚úÖ **Command Autocomplete:** Real-time command suggestions in CLI when typing '/' - improves UX and discoverability
    - ‚úÖ **Command System:** User commands (/clear, /history, /status, /tools, /help) fully implemented with immediate feedback
    - ‚úÖ **Conversation Context:** Fixed conversation history persistence across task instances - LLM now maintains full context between messages

    - WebSocket server is up and running, capable of basic message echoing.

## Known Issues

-   **MCP Server Discovery:** No automatic discovery mechanism for available MCP servers - requires manual configuration.
-   **MCP Configuration Persistence:** Server configurations are stored in memory and lost on restart. **‚úÖ RESOLVED:** Implemented persistent file-based storage with auto-reconnection.
-   **Error Recovery:** While reconnection is implemented, more sophisticated error recovery strategies could be beneficial.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement persistent MCP server configuration storage. *Reasoning:* User experience requires servers to remain configured across server restarts. File-based JSON storage provides simplicity, human-readability, and easy management while maintaining security through .gitignore protection.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement MCP protocol using official SDK rather than custom implementation. *Reasoning:* Official SDK provides better maintainability, compliance with protocol updates, and comprehensive feature support.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to use stdio transport for MCP communication. *Reasoning:* Standard approach recommended by MCP specification, well-supported, and suitable for local server connections.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement centralized MCP connection management through `MCPClientManager`. *Reasoning:* Provides clean separation of concerns, enables connection pooling, and simplifies error handling and reconnection logic.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement dual-mode question answering in CLI. *Reasoning:* Provides both efficiency (quick selection) and flexibility (custom input) to accommodate different user preferences and use cases.
-   **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Initial decision to use Markdown files for the Memory Bank. *Reasoning:* Human-readability, ease of editing, and version control friendliness.
-   **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Decision to start XML parsing with a regex-based approach. *Reasoning:* Simplicity for initial implementation. Will re-evaluate if complexity requires a dedicated library. (Tracked in `activeContext.md`).
