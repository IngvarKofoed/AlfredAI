# Progress

This document tracks what functionalities are working, what remains to be built, the current status of various components, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

-   **‚úÖ Browser Action Enhancement:** The browser action tool now provides efficient webpage interaction with memory-based content storage:
    - Modified all browser actions (launch, navigate, scroll_down, scroll_up) to store webpage content in memory instead of returning large HTML responses
    - Added new `askQuestion` action that uses Gemini completion provider to answer specific questions about stored webpage content
    - Implemented webpage content storage using the memory system with appropriate tags and metadata for retrieval
    - Returns short confirmation messages for all browsing actions to reduce response size
    - Uses the same Gemini completion provider as the HTML transformer for consistent content analysis
    - Proper validation and error handling for all actions including the new askQuestion functionality
    - Content is automatically cleared when browser is closed to prevent memory bloat
    - Significantly reduces response size while maintaining full functionality through memory storage
-   **‚úÖ Docker Tool:** Comprehensive Docker container and image management capabilities for hosting and running applications:
    - Complete Docker workflow support: run, build, stop, ps, logs, pull, exec, remove, images, network, create-dockerfile
    - Intelligent Dockerfile generation based on base image type (Node.js, Python, nginx, generic)
    - Port mapping, volume mounting, environment variable, and working directory support
    - Detached and interactive container execution modes
    - Docker availability detection with helpful installation guidance
    - Comprehensive parameter validation and error handling for all actions
    - Enhanced security considerations while maintaining Docker flexibility
    - Extensive examples covering web servers, development environments, and image building
    - Full integration with tool registry and system exports
-   **‚úÖ MCP Server Persistence:** MCP server configurations now persist across backend server restarts:
    - Server configurations are saved to `mcp-servers.json` file in JSON format
    - Configurations automatically load and reconnect on server startup
    - Supports adding, removing, and updating server configurations
    - Includes security protection via .gitignore for sensitive API keys
    - Example configuration file provided for user guidance
    - Integration with MCP consumer tool for complete server management
-   **‚úÖ /tools Command:** Comprehensive tool and capability discovery:
    - Shows all native tools (weather, randomNumber, executeCommand, mcpConsumer) with descriptions
    - Lists MCP server connection status (üü¢ Connected / üî¥ Disconnected)
    - Displays available tools from each connected MCP server with descriptions
    - Handles disconnected servers and errors gracefully
    - Provides guidance on how to use tools through natural conversation
    - Integrated with CLI autocomplete and help system
-   **‚úÖ Command Autocomplete (CLI):** The CLI now provides real-time command suggestions when users type '/':
    - Instantly shows all available commands with descriptions when '/' is typed
    - Navigation with arrow keys, Enter to select, Escape to cancel
    - Commands auto-execute when selected from the autocomplete menu
    - Visual distinction with blue border for command suggestions
    - Seamless integration with existing CLI input modes
    - Improves command discoverability and typing efficiency
-   **‚úÖ Command System:** Users can now use helpful commands for conversation management:
    - `/clear` - Clears conversation history and provides confirmation feedback
    - `/history` - Shows conversation history with message count and truncated content
    - `/status` - Displays system status including message count, available tools, and connection info
    - `/tools` - Lists all available tools and MCP servers with connection status
    - `/help` - Lists all available commands with descriptions
    - Commands are processed immediately without LLM involvement for fast response
    - Unknown commands provide helpful error messages directing users to available options
-   **‚úÖ Conversation Context Persistence:** The LLM now maintains context across multiple user messages within a session. The system:
    - Maintains conversation history at the Client level across task instances
    - Passes complete conversation history to each new ButlerTask
    - Preserves user messages, assistant responses, and follow-up interactions
    - Enables natural multi-turn conversations with full context retention
    - Provides logging for conversation history tracking and debugging
-   **‚úÖ CLI Dual-Mode Question Answering:** The CLI client now supports both predefined question selection and freeform text input when the AI provides questions. Users can:
    - Select from a list of predefined questions using arrow keys
    - Choose "‚úèÔ∏è Type custom answer..." to switch to freeform input mode
    - Type custom responses with full text input capabilities
    - Navigate back from custom input to selection using the Escape key
    - Visual distinction between modes (cyan border for selection, magenta for custom input)
-   **‚úÖ MCP Protocol Implementation:** Complete Model Context Protocol communication is now implemented and functional. The system can:
    - Connect to MCP servers using stdio transport
    - List available tools and resources from connected servers
    - Execute tools with parameters and receive results
    - Read resources from MCP servers
    - Handle connection management with automatic reconnection
    - Manage multiple MCP server connections simultaneously
-   **WebSocket Support:** The backend server now supports WebSocket connections. Clients can connect, send messages, and receive messages (currently echoes) via WebSockets.
-   **Memory Bank Foundation:** The core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been initialized.
-   The assistant (Gemini) can create and edit these Markdown files.
-   **`parseAssistantMessage` Integration:** The `parseAssistantMessage` function from [`backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`](backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts) has been integrated into the main application flow in [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts). A new POST route `/assistant/message` is now available to handle and parse assistant messages.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

-   **MCP Integration Testing:** End-to-end testing with real MCP servers to validate the implementation.
-   **Core Assistant Logic:**
    -   Message parsing (including the current XML parsing task).
    -   Intent recognition.
    -   Tool execution framework.
    -   Response generation.
    -   Advanced WebSocket message processing and integration with assistant core logic.
-   **Tool Implementations:** Specific implementations for each defined tool (e.g., `codebase_search`, `edit_file`, etc., beyond the AI's intrinsic ability to call them).
-   **Memory Bank Management Automation:** Scripts or functions for the assistant to more autonomously manage its Memory Bank updates (beyond just editing files when told).
-   **Testing Suite:** Unit and integration tests for all components.
-   **User Interface (if any beyond CLI/IDE integration):** To be defined.

## Known Issues

-   **MCP Server Discovery:** No automatic discovery mechanism for available MCP servers - requires manual configuration.
-   **MCP Configuration Persistence:** Server configurations are stored in memory and lost on restart. **‚úÖ RESOLVED:** Implemented persistent file-based storage with auto-reconnection.
-   **Error Recovery:** While reconnection is implemented, more sophisticated error recovery strategies could be beneficial.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement comprehensive Docker tool for containerization and application hosting. *Reasoning:* AI assistant needs capability to run and host applications in isolated environments. Single comprehensive tool with multiple actions provides better user experience than fragmented tools, while supporting full Docker workflow from development to deployment.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement persistent MCP server configuration storage. *Reasoning:* User experience requires servers to remain configured across server restarts. File-based JSON storage provides simplicity, human-readability, and easy management while maintaining security through .gitignore protection.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement MCP protocol using official SDK rather than custom implementation. *Reasoning:* Official SDK provides better maintainability, compliance with protocol updates, and comprehensive feature support.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to use stdio transport for MCP communication. *Reasoning:* Standard approach recommended by MCP specification, well-supported, and suitable for local server connections.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement centralized MCP connection management through `MCPClientManager`. *Reasoning:* Provides clean separation of concerns, enables connection pooling, and simplifies error handling and reconnection logic.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement dual-mode question answering in CLI. *Reasoning:* Provides both efficiency (quick selection) and flexibility (custom input) to accommodate different user preferences and use cases.
-   **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Initial decision to use Markdown files for the Memory Bank. *Reasoning:* Human-readability, ease of editing, and version control friendliness.
-   **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Decision to start XML parsing with a regex-based approach. *Reasoning:* Simplicity for initial implementation. Will re-evaluate if complexity requires a dedicated library. (Tracked in `activeContext.md`).
