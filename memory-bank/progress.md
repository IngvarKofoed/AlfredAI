# Progress

This document tracks what functionalities are working, what remains to be built, the current status of various components, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

-   **✅ CLI Dual-Mode Question Answering:** The CLI client now supports both predefined question selection and freeform text input when the AI provides questions. Users can:
    - Select from a list of predefined questions using arrow keys
    - Choose "✏️ Type custom answer..." to switch to freeform input mode
    - Type custom responses with full text input capabilities
    - Navigate back from custom input to selection using the Escape key
    - Visual distinction between modes (cyan border for selection, magenta for custom input)
-   **✅ MCP Protocol Implementation:** Complete Model Context Protocol communication is now implemented and functional. The system can:
    - Connect to MCP servers using stdio transport
    - List available tools and resources from connected servers
    - Execute tools with parameters and receive results
    - Read resources from MCP servers
    - Handle connection management with automatic reconnection
    - Manage multiple MCP server connections simultaneously
-   **WebSocket Support:** The backend server now supports WebSocket connections. Clients can connect, send messages, and receive messages (currently echoes) via WebSockets.
-   **Memory Bank Foundation:** The core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been initialized.
-   The assistant (Gemini) can create and edit these Markdown files.
-   **`parseAssistantMessage` Integration:** The `parseAssistantMessage` function from [`backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`](backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts) has been integrated into the main application flow in [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts). A new POST route `/assistant/message` is now available to handle and parse assistant messages.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

-   **MCP Integration Testing:** End-to-end testing with real MCP servers to validate the implementation.
-   **Core Assistant Logic:**
    -   Message parsing (including the current XML parsing task).
    -   Intent recognition.
    -   Tool execution framework.
    -   Response generation.
    -   Advanced WebSocket message processing and integration with assistant core logic.
-   **Tool Implementations:** Specific implementations for each defined tool (e.g., `codebase_search`, `edit_file`, etc., beyond the AI's intrinsic ability to call them).
-   **Memory Bank Management Automation:** Scripts or functions for the assistant to more autonomously manage its Memory Bank updates (beyond just editing files when told).
-   **Testing Suite:** Unit and integration tests for all components.
-   **User Interface (if any beyond CLI/IDE integration):** To be defined.
-   **MCP Server Configuration Management:** Persistent storage and management of MCP server configurations.

## Current Status

-   **Overall Project Status:** Development phase. Foundational infrastructure completed including MCP protocol implementation.
-   **Current Task:** CLI enhancement for dual-mode question answering completed successfully.
-   **Status:** 
    - ✅ **CLI Enhancement:** Dual-mode question answering (selection + freeform input) fully implemented
    - ✅ **MCP Protocol:** Fully implemented using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` with real client-server communication
    - ✅ **WebSocket Support:** Successfully integrated into [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts)
    - ✅ **Message Parsing:** POST route `/assistant/message` handles and parses assistant messages
    - ✅ **Tool Framework:** MCP Consumer Tool provides complete MCP server interaction capabilities
    - WebSocket server is up and running, capable of basic message echoing.

## Known Issues

-   **MCP Server Discovery:** No automatic discovery mechanism for available MCP servers - requires manual configuration.
-   **MCP Configuration Persistence:** Server configurations are stored in memory and lost on restart.
-   **Error Recovery:** While reconnection is implemented, more sophisticated error recovery strategies could be beneficial.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement MCP protocol using official SDK rather than custom implementation. *Reasoning:* Official SDK provides better maintainability, compliance with protocol updates, and comprehensive feature support.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to use stdio transport for MCP communication. *Reasoning:* Standard approach recommended by MCP specification, well-supported, and suitable for local server connections.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement centralized MCP connection management through `MCPClientManager`. *Reasoning:* Provides clean separation of concerns, enables connection pooling, and simplifies error handling and reconnection logic.
-   **[2025-01-XX]:** Decision to implement dual-mode question answering in CLI. *Reasoning:* Provides both efficiency (quick selection) and flexibility (custom input) to accommodate different user preferences and use cases.
-   **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Initial decision to use Markdown files for the Memory Bank. *Reasoning:* Human-readability, ease of editing, and version control friendliness.
-   **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Decision to start XML parsing with a regex-based approach. *Reasoning:* Simplicity for initial implementation. Will re-evaluate if complexity requires a dedicated library. (Tracked in `activeContext.md`).
