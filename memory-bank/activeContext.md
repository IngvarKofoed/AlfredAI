# Active Context

This document tracks the current focus of development, recent significant changes, immediate next steps, active decisions, and important learnings or patterns that have emerged.

## Current Work Focus

-   **Task:** Integration of `parseAssistantMessage` function.
-   **Files:** [`backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`](backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts), [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts)
-   **Goal:** The `parseAssistantMessage` function has been successfully integrated into the main application flow. A new POST route `/assistant/message` in [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts) now handles and parses incoming assistant messages using this function.

## Recent Changes

-   Initialized the Memory Bank by creating the core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
-   Successfully integrated the `parseAssistantMessage` function into [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts), exposing a new POST route `/assistant/message`.

## Next Steps

1.  Perform end-to-end testing of the new `/assistant/message` route to ensure the `parseAssistantMessage` function behaves as expected within the application context.
2.  Begin development or refinement of how the `AssistantCore` (or equivalent component) utilizes the parsed message data.
3.  Continue to evaluate the performance and error handling of the regex-based parsing, especially with more diverse test cases.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

-   **XML Parsing Strategy:** The initial regex-based approach for extracting tag names and content has been implemented and unit tested. The tests confirm its behavior for valid and malformed XML, and messages with no XML. Further evaluation is needed to determine if a more robust XML parser library (like `xml2js` or `fast-xml-parser`) is necessary for handling increased complexity or edge cases in the future.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

-   **Memory Bank First:** Always consult and update the Memory Bank before and after significant tasks.
-   **TypeScript for Backend:** Backend logic will be implemented in TypeScript.
-   **Modularity:** Aim for small, well-defined functions and modules.

## Learnings & Project Insights

-   The initial setup of the Memory Bank is crucial for establishing a baseline understanding of the project, even for the AI assistant itself.
-   Clear definition of tasks and next steps in `activeContext.md` helps maintain focus.
-   Unit testing early in the development cycle, as demonstrated with the XML parsing function, significantly improves confidence in the correctness and robustness of core functionalities.
