## Active Decisions & Considerations

-   **Docker Tool Design:** Chose to implement a comprehensive tool covering the full Docker workflow rather than separate tools for each operation. This provides better user experience and clearer tool discovery while maintaining parameter-based action selection.
-   **Docker Security:** Implemented basic command validation to prevent obviously dangerous operations while maintaining Docker's inherent flexibility and power.
-   **Dockerfile Generation:** Chose to implement smart template generation based on base image type rather than generic templates, providing immediate value and following Docker best practices for common technology stacks.
-   **MCP Configuration Format:** Chose to use the exact format requested by the user with `mcpServers` object structure. This provides a clean, organized way to manage multiple server configurations.
-   **File-based Persistence:** Decided to use JSON file storage for MCP configurations rather than a database. This keeps the solution simple, human-readable, and easily portable.
-   **Security Considerations:** Added configuration file to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits of sensitive API keys or tokens.
-   **Auto-reconnection:** Implemented automatic reconnection on server startup to provide seamless user experience after server restarts.
-   **CLI UX Enhancement:** Implemented dual-mode question answering to provide users with both structured selection and flexible freeform input options. This enhances user experience by not restricting them to only predefined choices.
-   **CLI Navigation:** Used Escape key for returning from custom input to selection mode, providing intuitive navigation within the question-answering interface.
-   **Visual Distinction:** Applied different border colors (cyan for selection, magenta for custom input) to clearly communicate the current interaction mode to users.
-   **MCP Architecture:** Chose to implement MCP client functionality through a centralized `MCPClientManager` class that handles connection lifecycle, reconnection logic, and provides a clean interface for the tool system.
-   **MCP Transport:** Using stdio transport as the primary communication method with MCP servers, which is the standard approach recommended by the MCP specification.
-   **Connection Management:** Implemented automatic reconnection with exponential backoff for robust MCP server connectivity.
-   **XML Parsing Strategy:** The initial regex-based approach for extracting tag names and content has been implemented and unit tested. The tests confirm its behavior for valid and malformed XML, and messages with no XML. Further evaluation is needed to determine if a more robust XML parser library (like `xml2js` or `fast-xml-parser`) is necessary for handling increased complexity or edge cases in the future.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

-   **Configuration Management:** Configuration files should be excluded from version control when they may contain sensitive information. Always provide example files for guidance.
-   **Persistence Strategy:** File-based persistence is appropriate for configuration data that needs to be human-readable and easily managed.
-   **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation when external services (like MCP servers) are unavailable, with proper logging and user feedback.
-   **Autocomplete UX Pattern:** Real-time suggestions improve discoverability and efficiency. Commands should show on-demand help rather than requiring users to remember syntax.
-   **Command System Design:** User commands (prefixed with /) provide immediate system functionality without LLM involvement, ensuring fast response times and consistent behavior.
-   **User Experience First:** Commands include helpful feedback, error messages, and emojis for better user experience.
-   **Memory Bank First:** Always consult and update the Memory Bank before and after significant tasks.
-   **TypeScript for Backend:** Backend logic will be implemented in TypeScript.
-   **Modularity:** Aim for small, well-defined functions and modules.
-   **User Experience Focus:** Prioritize intuitive and flexible user interactions, providing multiple ways to accomplish tasks when beneficial.
-   **Clear Visual Communication:** Use visual cues (colors, borders, text prompts) to clearly communicate interface state and available actions.
-   **MCP Integration:** MCP servers should be treated as external services with proper error handling, connection management, and graceful degradation when unavailable.
-   **Real Protocol Implementation:** Prefer using official SDKs and real protocol implementations over placeholder or mock implementations.
