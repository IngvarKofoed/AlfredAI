# Active Context

This document tracks the current focus of development, recent significant changes, immediate next steps, active decisions, and important learnings or patterns that have emerged.

## Current Work Focus

-   **Task:** Implement a TypeScript function to parse XML tags from a string.
-   **File:** `backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`
-   **Goal:** This function is a foundational piece for enabling the assistant to understand structured data within user messages or tool outputs.

## Recent Changes

-   Initialized the Memory Bank by creating the core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## Next Steps

1.  Define the requirements for the XML parsing function (e.g., handling multiple tags, attributes, self-closing tags, nested tags).
2.  Choose an appropriate approach or library for XML parsing in TypeScript (e.g., regex, a dedicated XML parsing library).
3.  Implement the `parseXmlTags` function in `backend/src/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`.
4.  Write unit tests for the parsing function.
5.  Update `progress.md` to reflect the completion of this task.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

-   **XML Parsing Strategy:** Need to decide whether a simple regex-based approach is sufficient or if a more robust XML parser library (like `xml2js` or `fast-xml-parser`) is necessary. Given the potential complexity of XML, a library might be a better long-term choice for robustness, but for now, a regex might be simpler to start with for basic tag extraction.
    -   *Decision for now:* Start with a regex-based approach for extracting tag names and their content. If complexity increases, reconsider a library.
-   **Error Handling:** How should malformed XML or messages with no XML be handled? The function should likely return an empty array or a specific error indicator.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

-   **Memory Bank First:** Always consult and update the Memory Bank before and after significant tasks.
-   **TypeScript for Backend:** Backend logic will be implemented in TypeScript.
-   **Modularity:** Aim for small, well-defined functions and modules.

## Learnings & Project Insights

-   The initial setup of the Memory Bank is crucial for establishing a baseline understanding of the project, even for the AI assistant itself.
-   Clear definition of tasks and next steps in `activeContext.md` helps maintain focus.
