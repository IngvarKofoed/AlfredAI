# Product Context

This document describes the "why" behind the project, the problems it aims to solve, how it should ideally function, and the desired user experience.

## Problem Statement

Software developers, especially those working in complex or long-running projects, often face challenges in maintaining context and recalling specific details. This can lead to inefficiencies, repeated work, and a steeper learning curve for new team members or when returning to a project after a break.

The primary problem this AI assistant (codename: Alfred) aims to solve is to act as an intelligent partner that maintains project context, remembers critical information, and assists with various development tasks.

## How It Should Work

Alfred should:

1.  **Understand User Intent:** Parse natural language queries and commands from the user.
2.  **Maintain Context:** Utilize a "Memory Bank" to store and retrieve project-specific information, decisions, patterns, and progress.
3.  **Execute Tasks:** Leverage a set of tools to perform actions like code searching, file editing, running terminal commands, and web searches.
4.  **Learn and Adapt:** Continuously update its Memory Bank based on interactions and new information, improving its contextual understanding over time.
5.  **Proactive Assistance (Future Goal):** Eventually, identify patterns and offer suggestions or automate routine tasks.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Seamless Integration:** Alfred should feel like a natural extension of the developer's workflow. This will be achieved through two primary client interfaces:
    -   A Command Line Interface (CLI) for quick, terminal-based interactions.
    -   A web-based interface for richer, potentially more visual interactions.
    Both clients will communicate with the backend via WebSockets, using a standardized interface.
-   **Reliability:** The information provided and actions taken by Alfred must be accurate and trustworthy.
-   **Efficiency:** Alfred should help developers save time and reduce cognitive load.
-   **Clarity:** Interactions and the information stored in the Memory Bank should be clear, concise, and easily understandable.
-   **Control:** The user should always have control over Alfred's actions and the ability to review and correct its understanding.
